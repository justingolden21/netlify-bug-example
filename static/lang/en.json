			"Pomodoro Technique",
			"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. &ndash; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",
			"How to Use",
			"First, add tasks and an estimate of how many poms (pomodoro timer lengths) they will take to complete. Then, hit start and begin work on your first task. Take short and long breaks as guided by the timer. You can hit the skip button to finish early. You can click 'start at beginning' to reset all of your tasks. Go to settings to change your timer durations, intervals, sounds, and more."

Introduced in 1960, UTC combines atomic timekeeping with astronomical observations to provide a precise and consistent reference. Unlike GMT, which is based on Earth's rotation, UTC is based on atomic clocks, making it more accurate and stable. It serves as the basis for time zones worldwide and is crucial for international communication and technology."

					"Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a time zone based on the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and is affected by Earth's irregular rotation and the equation of time. In contrast, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a time standard that combines atomic time, measured by atomic clocks, with astronomical observations and uses periodic leap seconds to stay aligned with Earth's rotation. While GMT serves as a reference for some time zones, UTC provides a more precise and stable measure of time, used globally for synchronization and scientific purposes. GMT and UTC are closely aligned, but GMT can drift slightly, whereas UTC maintains accuracy with leap second adjustments, resulting in a difference of only a fraction of a second.",
					"New York time, like other time zones, is defined as an offset from UTC (e.g., UTC-5 or UTC-4) but does not directly involve leap seconds. Leap seconds are adjustments made to UTC itself to keep it aligned with Earth's rotation. Local time zones, including New York, adjust their time based on these updates to UTC."

It is often used in software and databases to ensure consistent timekeeping. It is also called Unix time, POSIX time, or Epoch time."
